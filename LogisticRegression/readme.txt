This fold contains the implementation of logistic regression algorithm :

1. logistic regression with gradient descent:
Implement the fixed learning rate gradient descent algorithm for logistic regression. Run the algorithm with η=0.001 and T=2000, what is Eout(g) from your algorithm, evaluated using the 0/1 error on the test set?

2. logistic regression with stochastic gradient descent:
Implement the fixed learning rate stochastic gradient descent algorithm for logistic regression. Instead of randomly choosing n in each iteration, please simply pick the example with the cyclic order n=1,2,…,N,1,2,…. Run the algorithm with η=0.001 and T=2000, what is Eout(g) from your algorithm, evaluated using the 0/1 error on the test set?
